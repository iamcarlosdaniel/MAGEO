SIGEMUV (Sistema de Gesti√≥n Integral de Eventos y Marketing de la Universidad del Valle) is a platform developed to comprehensively manage upcoming events, as well as coordinate with the Marketing and Maintenance departments to efficiently and effectively carry out the necessary tasks for these events.

In a dynamic environment with a high volume of requests for various activities, the efficiency of event management is crucial for the Marketing department. It is essential for maintaining relevance and attractiveness for the student community, external individuals, and stakeholders.
